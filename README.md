# React-Thesaurus
Thesaurus Built on React v16.0.0

## Instructions:
- Clone this repository to the directory of your choice. 

Note: To build and run this app, NPM needs to be running on your system. 
 How to install NPM: https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node

- Open up a terminal and cd to the directory you created for the cloned repo. 
- Run the following commands:
  - npm install (or npm i)
  - npm start
  
At this point the server is firing up. Once it has started, if you have the Chrome browser installed, it will automatically open the app in a new Chrome tab. 
If you do not have chrome, in the console it prints out the URL for the local server which is typically http://localhost:3000/.

The node server has the live reload package installed so any saved file changes you have made in your local repo will automatically be redeployed and the browser app with reload with your changes.
(Assuming you have Chrome, otherwise you will have to manually reload the page.
